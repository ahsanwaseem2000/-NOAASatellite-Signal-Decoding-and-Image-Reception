 This project embarked on an exciting endeavor to track and receive images from weather satellites, specifically
 NOAA15,using asoftware-defined radio (RTL-SDR) setup.
 The goal was to harness this technology to capture and process weather imagery directly from orbiting satellites,
 enabling the acquisition of real-time weather data for various applications
